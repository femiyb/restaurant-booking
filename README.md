# Project Information

## Project Type: WordPress Plugin

## Project Requirments

## Project Overview:
We are seeking an experienced WordPress developer to create a custom Restaurant Booking Plugin for our client's website. The goal of this project is to enable restaurant owners to efficiently manage table reservations through their WordPress-powered website. The plugin should provide a seamless booking experience for customers while offering robust management tools for restaurant staff.

## Features
Booking System: Develop a user-friendly booking interface for customers to select date, time, party size, and make reservations.
Real-time Availability: Implement a real-time availability system to prevent double bookings and provide instant confirmation to customers.
Customization: Allow restaurant owners to customize reservation settings, such as booking hours, party size limits, and booking lead times.
Special Requests: Include an option for customers to specify special requests or dietary preferences during the booking process.
Table Occupancy Management: Create a feature for restaurant staff to manage table occupancy, mark reservations as complete, and track no-shows.
Integration: Ensure seamless integration with various WordPress themes and other popular plugins for a cohesive website experience.
Responsive Design: Develop a mobile-responsive design to ensure a smooth booking process on all devices.

## Some hints
PHP 7+
Webpack
React
ES6/Typescript
Composer
No JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular or additional frameworks. WordPress is the framework, and it should work solid and be maintainable
Describe your decisions in README (short is better)

## About Composer dependencies
Composer support is mandatory, and pulling packages via Composer is an allowed practice. And because both tests and code style checks are required, some development dependencies will be there.

It is also allowed to use dependencies for production code. That said, we appreciate it when dependencies are kept to the very essential. Please use the README to briefly explain why a Composer package has been added.

At Inpsyde, we use Composer to manage the whole website code.
We use it to install WordPress itself, alongside all plugins and themes, and we load Composer autoload in wp-config.php. We will appreciate it if the delivered plugin will be compliant with this workflow.


## Additional mandatory features
Full Composer support
A README, in English, using markdown, explaining plugin usage and decisions behind implementation
Compliance with Inpsyde code style for the PHP Level, if necessary
Object-oriented code
Automated tests
A license, preferably in a LICENSE file in the repository root. We don’t require any specific license, nor will we ever share your work without your permission. The license should, at a very minimum, allow us to access and store your work. If you want to use an OS license, feel free to do so.
Usage of the WordPress native functionalities whenever possible (don’t reinvent the wheel).
The lack of optional features will not generate a negative evaluation. But truth to be told, we can’t say the same about poorly implemented optional features.
